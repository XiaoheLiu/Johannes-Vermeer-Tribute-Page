# Johannes Vermeer Tribute Page
A tribute page to the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer in the 17th century.

This page showcases my skills to use:
- Basic html
- Basic CSS
- Color theory to achieve an elegant visual design.

This is one of the five projects that I did for the Responsive Web Design Certificate at freeCodeCamp.org : "[Build a Tribute Page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page/)".
